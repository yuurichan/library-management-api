deleted "type":"module" in package.json since in tsconfig we're exporting from "target":"es6/2016" to "module":"commonjs".
and we don't want  to use ES6 Module syntax to read CommonJS files

this link really helped (the last section to be more specific):
https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-uncaught-referenceerror-exports-is-not-defined

we're compiling TS in ES6 syntax to CommonJS

npm install && npm run clean && 
npm i --save body-parser sequelize sequelize-typescript
